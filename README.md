# u2Query
Hopefully useful and universal (u2) javaScript modules build out of selected jQuery functionality

> The original purpose of this small project was to encapsulate jQerys each-function into a node module and to understand it's type-function in depth

### Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install u2query --save
